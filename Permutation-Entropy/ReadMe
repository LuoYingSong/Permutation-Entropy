The file [2002,PRL]Permutation Entropy-A Natural Complexity Measure for Time Series.pdf proposes the classic permutation entropy algorithm, here we reproduce the classic permutation entropy algorithm, and independently generated 10 sets of different data, data1 ,data2,...,data9,data10, run main.py to directly start the permutation entropy algorithm to read these 10 sets of data to calculate the permutation entropy result.
